        <h1>Happy Birthday Cherth !</h1>
        <p>This poem is for my friend,<br>
            To the person I love the most,<br>
            And loves the most.

        </p>

        <p>
            My relation with you,<br>
            Has been through its ups and downs,<br>
            But like the cosmos,<br>
            Where darkness represents my life,<br>
            And the stars as the clusters of my friendships,<br>
            You, with your beauty and kindess,<br>
            Has lit up my life,<br>
            Like that one special star,<br>
            That brightens up the whole night sky.
        </p>

        <p>
            If I leave the world early,<br>
            And it makes you worry,<br>
            Remember that your presence was my happiness,<br>
            When my mind was stuck in the wilderness.
        </p>

        <p>
            My love for you,<br>
            Will last for eternity,<br>
            Thus this poem,<br>
            Which will attain immortality,<br>
            That even if the world comes to an end,<br>
            You will always be,<br>
            MY   BEST   FRIEND.
